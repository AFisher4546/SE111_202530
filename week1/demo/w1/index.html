        <h1>Andrew Fisher</h1>

        <p>My name is <b>Andrew Fisher</b>, I'm 19, and here are some things about me. First off, I'm a <u>gamer</u> born and raised, grew up playing Mario and now play Halo. I'm a <b>massive</b> dog lover, I have mutliple throughout my family that I love, especially my Lab mix, Brody. I don't often watch shows or movies, but when I do, it's one of my 3 favorite Indie animation series <i>Hazbin Hotel</i>, <i>Helluva Boss</i>, and <b>Murder Drones</b>, the latter of which are on Youtube while the first is on Prime. Now, if you're <b><i><u>anything</u></i></b> like me, you should probably check them out! Even if you're not like me(<i>that's fine</i>), you should still check them out, I promise you wouldn't regret it!</p>
